## Training stages

+ This section describes each training stage need for achieve social cooperation project goal.
+ Training will concist of 4 stages with the same organization as in the alternate experiment.


----



### Stage 1
 
+ **Goal:** To familiarize mice with ports and reward systems using lights.
+ **Task:** Mouse has to insert nose in port when the light comes on (controlled by experimenter) to obtain reward (water). Lights turn on at the same time on both ports on the same side.
+ **Details and parameters:** [[Stage 1]]

----


### Stage 2

+ **Goal:** To teach mice to synchronize between them port activation for reward (through ligths).
+ **Task:** Mice must coordinate poking of ports to obtain reward within 3 second window (Task mode: Reward_on_last_poke). Lights turn on once a mouse has started a trial poking its nose into the available port on the randomly chose side. 
+ **Details and parameters:** [[Stage 2]]

----


### Stage 3

+ **Goal:** To teach mice to synchronize port activation for reward without light as a stimulus (LED will still flash when reward is granted to both mice)
+ **Task:** Mice must coordinate poking of ports the obtain reward within 3 second window (Task Mode: cooperate). Only if mice get the reward, next available pair of ports is selected randomly, otherwise stay the same.
+ **Details and parameters:** [[Stage 3]]

----


### Stage 4

+ **Goal:** To teach mice to synchronize port activation in a shorter time period for reward without light as a stimulus.(LED will still flash when reward is granted to both mice).
+ **Task:** Mice must coordinate poking of ports to obtain reward within 1 second window (Task Mode: cooperate).
+ **Details and parameters:** [[Stage 4]]



## Troubleshootings

### Hard learning

> + I was thinking that could be difficult to mice jump from the stage 1 to stage 2 where stage 1 teachs them to use ports and immediately stage 2 force them to discover the available pair of ports together.
>> + **Possible solution:** Maybe mice will need an extra stage before stage 2 same as this but with lights turning on indicating availability of port and not releasing water until they both arrive to the borth within a time window once a trial has started.

### Desperate behavior

> + I was thinking that the inter-trial interval might give them **despair** since nothing happens during that time. That could be leading them to not focus on the purpose of the task, which is to find the available port together after a period of time has passed, therefore they do not learn or learn take much time.
>> + **Possible solution:** Maybe during early stages, turn all lights on during the inter-trial interval in a static mode o flashing mode (maybe this could produce a stress state), in order to teach them that their is a moment of nothing happening.
>> + This will be applied only if I decide to establish a intermediate stage between stage 1 and 2.

### Incomplete isolation

> + Do they can hear each other through the solid barrier? In some of the videos I watched I noticed that during the solid barrier they were almost like capable of arrive to the same side as their partner, could be only coincidence, but I started suspect that they can hear each other and that is a kind of communication.
> + This is more a futuristic concern.

### Criteria to move to the nex stage

> + **Precedent:** Criteria for moving to the next stage were developed by first estimating what approximate performance would demonstrate that the mice had mastered the task they are on. After that, adjustments were made based on what level the mice actually were able to perform at in a realistic amount of time. In summary, the criteria for moving from one stage to another should allow for the mice to fully learn the stage they are on. If you are changing parameters there will probably be some guesswork and you will probably have to experiment to find the right criteria for moving to the next stage.
> + **My thinking:** At least first critera can be the same as Brigid as a starting point, since is almost the same stage. as a first approach given that is more a guesswork, **How would I estimate the requirements for move forward?** I would mean the number of rewards obtained by each mouse in stage 1, then if they working together we can suposse of the as one individual, so the theorical estimation would be that to move to the next stage they would have to achieve a number of rewards similar to that computed mean. However, all is behavior-dependent.

## Results

> + **How do we know our experiment success, in other words, how can we know that mice are cooperating?**
>> Well, using the approach of perforate barrier and solid barrier, we should see a decrease in performance (% win trials) in isolation (solid barrier) compared with access to most senses (perforate barrier).
> + **How do we show that decreasing?**
>>  I propose to use the bar chart. **Why?** because this plot let me compare a numerical variable (average mutual rewards) measured in different categorical variables (solid and perforate barrier). 
>>  **Average mutal rewards=** sum of the rewards obtained in every day of evaluation divide by the number of days. Example: 
>>>  In this case we would change cumulative mutual rewards for average mutual regard. **Why?** because we standarized by time (1 hr a day). How many rewards they can achieved in 1 hr? 
>>> The initiation of the trial is subject to the behavior of every mice (what if one is thistier than the other one?), so to compute by performance we would have to standirized by trials (?), which is harder, because if one mouse started initiating many trials and the other is not coopering then the performance would be lower and I think is a bias.
