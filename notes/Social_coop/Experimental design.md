+ This document describes the experimental design that will be apply to achieved the objectives of the social cooperation project escribed in [[Seek-and-find approach description]] document.

# Training stages

+ This section describes each training stage need for achieve social cooperation project goal.
+ Training will concist of 4 stages with the same organization as in the alternate experiment.

## Stage 1
 
+ **Goal:** to familiarize mice with ports and reward systems using lights.
+ **Task:** Mouse has to insert nose in port when the light comes on (controlled by experimenter) to obtain reward (water).
+ **Details and parameters:** [[Stage 1]]

----


## Stage 2

+ **Goal:** To teach mice to synchronize port activation for reward.
+ **Task:** Mice must coordinate poking of ports to obtain reward within 3 second window (Task mode: Reward_on_last_poke).
+ **Details and parameters:** [[Stage 2]]

----


## Stage 3

+ **Goal:** To teach mice to synchronize port activation for reward without light as a stimulus (LED will still flash when reward is granted to both mice)
+ **Task:** Mice must coordinate poking of ports the obtain reward within 3 second window (Task Mode: cooperate)
+ **Details and parameters:** [[Stage 3]]

----


## Stage 4

+ **Goal:** To teach mice to synchronize port activation in a shorter time period for reward without light as a stimulus.(LED will still flash when reward is granted to both mice).
+ **Task:** Mice must coordinate poking of ports to obtain reward within 1 second window (Task Mode: cooperate).
+ **Details and parameters:** [[Stage 4]]
