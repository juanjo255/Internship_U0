+ This document describes everything in detail about the **stage 1**.
+ So far, probably stage 1 will use the same alternate mode as the alternate experiment, since this stage is only focus in teach mouse use the ports.

# Objectives

> ## Specific objective
> + Mouse has to insert nose in port when the light comes on (controlled by experimenter) to obtain reward (water).
> ## General objective
> + Familiarize mice with ports and reward systems using lights.

# Detail description

> + Two mice at the same time (on different tracks).
> + Two lights on the same side turn on at the same time (automatically by the paradigm).
> + To get reward, a mouse has to insert its nose into port while the light is on.
> + Either mice or both mice can obtain a reward.
> + **Every 3 seconds the light will alternate sides. The light is on for the whole 3 seconds**.
> + Reward is obtainable for the whole 3 second period.
> + If an animal does not poke, no reward or punishment occurs on that track/port.
> + Only one reward per time period per track.
> + **Criteria for moving to next stage: Mice must spend three training sessions on this stage as well as have 800 initiated trials minimum per day.** Next Stage: [[Stage 2]].
