+ This document describes everything in detail about the **stage 1**.

# Objectives

> ## Specific objective
> + Mouse has to insert nose in port when the light comes on (controlled by experimenter) to obtain reward (water).
> ## General objective
> + Familiarize mice with ports and reward systems using lights.

# Detail description

> + Two mice at the same time (on different tracks).
> + To get reward, a mouse has to insert its nose into a port while the light is on.
> + Either mice or both mice can obtain a reward.
> + Two lights on the same randomly selected side will turn on at the same time indicating the available port to get the reward (water).
> + **The light will turn on for 3 seconds, after that time will be a 3 seconds timeout regardless of if it has been successful (mouse get the reward) or not. A new side will be selected randomly only if a mouse get the reward, otherwise the same side will turn on**.
> + **Criteria for moving to next stage: Mice must spend three training sessions on this stage as well as have 800 initiated trials minimum per day.** Next Stage: [[Stage 2]].
