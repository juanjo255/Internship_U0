+ This document describes everything in detail related with the **Stage 2**.

# Objectives

> ## Specific objective
>> + Mice must coordinate poking of ports to obtain reward within 3 second window (Task mode: Reward_on_last_poke).
> ## General objective
>> + Teach mice to synchronize port activation for reward.

# Detail description

> + The first trial will be randomly chosed. Trials will change randomly from then on, but only when mice get the water (successful trial).
> + Whichever mouse reaches port first, both lights on the same side will turn on for 3 seconds and the second mouse will have that time to reach it and obtain a reward.
> + **A reward will only be given if they both insert their nose into the same port within the 3 seconds they are granted.**
> + Reward is obtainable for the whole 3 second period.
> + Two lights on the same side turn on at the same time by the “initiating” mouse (whichever mouse runs to a port first).
> + The initiating mouse is the one who finds the available port first, after the initianing mouse will have to wait until the other mouse poke to obtain the water.
> + When time is over and the light is off, mice will have to wait 3 seconds before try again. regardless of if the trial succeeds (the second mouse poke after the initiating during the 3 seconds window) or fails (only the initiating mouse poked) the 3 seconds timeout is applied, but if trial fails the port will not be randomly selected again, stays the same.
