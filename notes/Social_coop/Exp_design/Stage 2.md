+ This document describes everything in detail related with the **Stage 2**.

# Objectives

> ## Specific objective
>> + Mice must coordinate poking of ports to obtain reward within 3 second window (Task mode: Reward_on_last_poke).
> ## General objective
>> + Teach mice to synchronize port activation for reward.

# Detail description

> + Whichever mouse reaches port first, both lights on the same side will turn on for 3 seconds and the second mouse will have that time to reach it and obtain a reward.
> + A reward will only be given if they both insert their nose into the same port within the 3 seconds they are granted.
> + Two lights on the same side turn on at the same time by the “initiating” mouse (whichever mouse runs to a port first).
> + The initiating mouse does not get its reward simply for inserting nose first into a port. They will have to wait until the trailing mouse pokes the same side to obtain reward.
> + **A reward is only given when both mice poke the same side within 3 seconds of each other.**
> + The first trial will be randomly chosed. Trials will change randomly from then on.
> + Both mice will either get a reward or not.
> + After the light turns off, either mouse has to initiate the turning on of the light by running to the other side and inserting the nose in port.
> + Reward is obtainable for the whole 3 second period.
> + If an animal does not poke, no reward will occur for either.
> + Only one reward per time period per track.
> + After fail (only first mouse initiates and second mouse does not activate port within 3 second window) The active port will be on the opposite side of the rig.
