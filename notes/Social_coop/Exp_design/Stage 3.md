+ This document describes everything in detail related with the **Stage 3**.

# Objectives

> ## Specific objective
>> + Mice must coordinate poking of ports the obtain reward within 3 second window (Task Mode: cooperate).
> ## General objective
>> + To teach mice to synchronize port activation for reward without light as a stimulus (LED will still flash when reward is granted to both mice)

-   Whichever mouse reaches port first, will initialize a 3 second trial on that side.
-   The second mouse will have that time to reach it and obtain a reward.
-   A reward will only be given if they both insert their nose into the same port within the 3 seconds they are granted.
-   The initiating mouse does not get its reward simply for inserting nose first into a port. They will have to wait until the trailing mouse pokes the same side to obtain reward.
-   A reward is only given when both mice poke the same side within 3 seconds of each other.
-   The first trial will be the south side of the rig. Trials will alternate from then on.
-   Both mice will either get a reward or not.
-   After the 3 second period regardless of whether a reward was given or not, either mouse can initiate another trial by running to the opposite side and inserting the nose in port.
-   Reward is obtainable for the whole 3 second period.
-   If an animal does not poke, no reward will occur for either.
-   Only one reward per time period per track.
-   After fail (only first mouse initiates and second mouse does not activate port within 3 second window) The active port will be on the opposite side of the rig.
- 1.  **Criteria for moving to next stage: 500 initiated trials for 3 consecutive days with greater than 50% rewarded**
