# Graphs

+ Here, I show some of the graphs that can be make to present results:
	+ At a glance, I checked a paper with a same objective as mine [Protocol for quantitative assessment of social cooperation in mice](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666166721000125?via%3Dihub)
	+ There, they used connected scatterplots, graphs highly use to display the evolution of a numeric variable, but every point that correspond to a data collected in a certain day also shows standard error of the mean (SEM). 
		+ Example:
			![[coop.png | 500]] 


	+ Scatter plot + line chart, this graph is usefull to show all the data collected (scatter plot) and trendency of this data (line chart).
		+ Example:
		![[scatter_line_chart.png | 500]]


	+ Another graph that I find interesting is the parallel coordinates plot. This graph let me plot at the same time the same feature for several individual observations. Given that 3 pair of mice would be used, maybe could be used even to compare against alternate experiment.
